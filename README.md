# Fantasy Strategy

(names aren't my strong suit)

This is a game I'm making. I Don't really have much done. I've always wanted to make a Fire Emblem-esk game.

One of my main hopes with this game is to apply what I learn in my AI class with regards to searching, and to make a dope game.

### Requirements to Run
----
This is written in lua using the Love Framework.

All that is required to run the game is Love 0.10.0, I will be upgrading the latest versions as they release and when I have the time.

I make my maps with Tiled using [KenneyNL's](https://www.kenney.nl) great free tilesets. All maps need to be exported in lua in order for the game to render them.

I also use Tiled to create units and the UI. This is just because it is easy and I'm not an artist. These also use tilesets from [KenneyNL](https://www.kenney.nl).
